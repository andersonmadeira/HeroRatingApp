# HeroRatingApp

React Native version of the Hero Rating App

## Motivation

This project is inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTCBUgezVMo&t=3s&ab_channel=AnggaRisky) Android Studio tutorial, it uses the same assets but the RN way. The intent here is to show some basic and useful features of [expo](https://expo.io/) to build RN apps instead of a bare RN project setup.

* [x] Background Images
* [x] Linear Gradients
